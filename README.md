This repository contains a curated example dataset developed for research on Arabic paraphrase evaluation, semantic similarity, and category-based text clustering. The dataset is part of an ongoing research project focusing on measuring the impact of text similarity across different semantic conditions.
The example set includes three controlled categories:

## 1. Paraphrased Pairs (High Semantic Similarity)

This category includes pairs of sentences that express the same meaning using different wording. These samples are designed to support paraphrase detection models, similarity scoring systems, and evaluation metrics.

## 2. Same Category – Not Paraphrased

Sentences in this category belong to the same topic/domain but are not paraphrases of each other.
They share thematic similarity but differ in structure, intent, or detailed meaning.
This subset helps test topic-level similarity, category clustering, and semantic drift handling.

## 3. Different Category – Not Pairs

Statements in this category come from distinct domains, ensuring low semantic similarity.
These samples are included to test contrastive learning, negative sampling, and the boundaries of semantic similarity models.
